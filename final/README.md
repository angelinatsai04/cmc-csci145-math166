# Final Exam

1. Your final exam will be worth 128 points.

    156 points total in the class => almost 50% of grade.

1. For the initial problem:
    1. I will give you a modified copy of `learning_pipeline.py`
        1. Certain sections from STEP 2, 4, or 5 may be removed (e.g. "convert non-numeric columns to numeric" or "PCA the data")
        1. There will be only one model defined
        1. Any hard-coded constants might be changed
        1. The files `example*.py` provide examples
    1. I will tell you the output of any print statements
    1. You will describe a plan to improve performance using that same model

1. Expect follow up questions about all models
    1. You should know the effect of all hyperparameters on runtime and statistical error
    1. You should know typical ranges for all hyperparameters

1. Expect review questions from the second midterm

    (especially about concepts that you missed)

1. Your final exam will not explicitly cover pagerank

    1. why?
        1. the main purpose of pagerank was as an exercise in understanding the runtime of numeric algorithms
        1. the pagerank material won't be explicitly asked of you in an interview setting,

            but all the material on your final will

    1. Your final exam score can still replace first midterm score

       If you did poorly on the first midterm,
       expect me to ask lots of questions about the runtime of gradient descent / stochastic gradient descent / perceptron

**My availability:**

1. Standard office hours Tuesday 9-11am.

    Friday 9-11am is capstone presentations, so I'm not available.

1. Dedicated final review sessions Thursday 9-11am and Friday 1-3pm.

## Extra Credit Homework

You may get up to 4 points of extra credit for finding good hyperparameters for the GermanCreditData.

In particular, if you train a model that has validation accuracy of:
1. $>=0.74$, you will get 1 point
1. $>=0.75$, you will get 1 more point
1. $>=0.76$, you will get 1 more point
1. $>=0.77$, you will get 1 more point

You may not modify any code in STEP 0, 1 or 3.

You may collaborate with at most 1 person.

To claim the extra credit, submit to sakai:
1. your code
1. your final validation score
1. anyone with whom you collaborated
